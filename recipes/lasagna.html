        <p>When John Chandler submitted this lasagna recipe to 
            Allrecipes more than 20 years ago, he had no idea
            how successful it would become. One of our 
            top-performing recipes of all time, World's Best 
            Lasagna racks up more than 7 million views per 
            year and has ranked among the most popular lasagna
            recipes on the internet for two decades.</p>

                <p>The Allrecipes community adores this lasagna
                    recipe because it's incredibly customizable, 
                    so you can easily alter the ingredient list 
                    to suit your needs. If you want to stay true 
                    to the original recipe, though, these are the
                    ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list.</p>
