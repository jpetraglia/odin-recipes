Building a basic recipes website with the HTML knowledge i've learnt from TOP until this point. 

So I learnt how to make a very basic page that allows me to link pages relatively to food recipes and also a back button to the main page. 
I also learnt how to use img sources and create unordered and numbered lists for ingredients and steps for the recipes. 
Pretty fun actually, not difficult at all. I wanted to try and make it look more pretty but I'm assuming that will come later.
